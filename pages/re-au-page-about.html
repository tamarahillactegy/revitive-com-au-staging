	<h2>Powered by science, inspired by you&hellip;</h2>
	<p>Our history in the UK began in London in 2003 by Josh and Roseanna Penny. We believe everyone deserves to feel good about their health. If you do, you can feel confident in yourself and in life. For this reason we design, develop and distribute innovative healthcare technology brands that have a positive impact on people&rsquo;s health. Through science and clinical studies we ensure our products are all effective, easy and enjoyable to use and can be incorporated into everyday life. We work closely with scientists, medical professionals, design engineers and our customers to continually develop our products so they are always the best in their field.</p>
	<p>In March 2012 we changed our company name from High Tech Health to Actegy Health and it marks the start of a very exciting period for us. Revitive is the new brand name for the Circulation Booster. We are so proud of the history of the Circulation Booster and the journey to Revitive.</p>
