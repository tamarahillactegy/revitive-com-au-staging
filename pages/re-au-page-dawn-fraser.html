	<p>Dawn Fraser won eight Olympic medals, including four gold medals, and six Commonwealth Games gold medals. She also held 39 records. The 100 metres freestyle record was hers for 15 years from 1 December 1956 to 8 January 1972.</p>
	<p>She is the first of only three swimmers in Olympic history to win individual gold medals for the same event at three successive Olympics (100 metres freestyle – 1956, 1960, 1964).</p>
	<p>In October 1962, she became the first woman to swim 100 metres freestyle in less than one minute. It was not until 1973, eight years after Fraser retired, that her 100m record of 58.9 secs was broken.</p>
	<p>She was named the Australian of the Year in 1964, was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1967, and appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1998. Also in 1998, she was voted Australia's greatest female athlete in history. She was named Australian Female Athlete of the Century by the Sport Australian Hall of Fame.</p>
	<p>In 1999 the International Olympic Committee named her the World's Greatest Living Female Water Sports Champion. On 14 July 2000, Fraser was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for "outstanding contribution as a swimming competitor".</p>
	<p>We are very proud to have Dawn as a product advocate for the REVITIVE IX.</p>
	<p>When approached about becoming an Ambassador for REVITIVE she stated, in true Dawn fashion, “does it work or is it just another gimmick”, she is now a regular user and a true believer in the health benefits that the REVITIVE IX delivers. Dawn is passionate about non drug therapies and has witnessed first-hand how this device is changing people’s lives all over the world.</p>
